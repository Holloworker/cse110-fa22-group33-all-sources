**Overarching Decisions** - we will eventually capture these as an ADR in markdown Links to an external site.(/specs/adrs will contain an individual document per major decision.  There will be some initial ones that have to do with general project plan and approach, but more may be added as the project goes on.  The main point of this capture is to explain why choices are made.  As brainstorming may have your team settle on choices quickly capturing them in a document may be better than just mental consensus)
