## Meeting Notes

### CI 

(As per Bradley and Steven's Implementation)
1. All work is to be done in the **DEV** branch!
2. When your feature is ready for testing, make a pull request from **DEV** branch to **STAGE** branch for our automatic tests to be run
3. This pull request into **STAGE** branch is to be reviewed by two people and automated tests are to be run. Once successful, we merge into **STAGE** branch.
4. Inside the **STAGE** branch manual testing will be done by developers for anything not covered by automatic testing
5. At completion of all testing (manual and automatic), make a pull request from **STAGE** to **MAIN**. This request is again reviewed by two people.
6. When successful, the PR goes through and the code is deployed to our chosen mode of delivery.

*Note: the CI pipeline right now only lints code to ensure that the process runs. More will be added to the CI pipeline. If you encounter issues, please consult Bradley or Steven!*
