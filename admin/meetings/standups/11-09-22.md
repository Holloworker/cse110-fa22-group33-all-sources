Yesterday I met with Clarissa and we outlined which parts of the weekly calendar we're implementing this sprint and how we're going to work together to do that. 
Today, I'm going to get as much of the javascript done as possible.

### Steven
Yesterday, I looked into testing for JavaScript to help Bradley. Today, I looked further into examples for the tool we chose so I would have a better idea of how to approach creating the tests for the future.

### Shasta
Today, River and I met up to synchronize our "Current Tasks" + "Add Tasks" page. We have a prototype page up and running which allows users to input tasks, which are stored locally and displayed below. The user's name can be inputted at the top and that is also stored locally.
