### [Upcoming Brainstorming Assignment Requirements](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/39754/assignments/526057)
**Overarching Decisions** - we will eventually capture these as an ADR in markdown Links to an external site.(/specs/adrs will contain an individual document per major decision.  There will be some initial ones that have to do with general project plan and approach, but more may be added as the project goes on.  The main point of this capture is to explain why choices are made.  As brainstorming may have your team settle on choices quickly capturing them in a document may be better than just mental consensus) \
**User Centered Thinking Documents** - we will produce personasLinks to an external site., user storiesLinks to an external site., and potentially use cases.Links to an external site. (/specs/users will contain this but user stories chosen will also be represented as issues to work on)\
**System Diagrams** - we will eventually capture how your app will be decomposed in C4 diagramLinks to an external site., event modeling diagramLinks to an external site., or UMLLinks to an external site. \
**Interface Design Documents** - we will initially capture "fat marker design" later extended with wireframes and high fidelity prototypes (/specs/interface/rough, /specs/interface/wireframes, /specs/interface/highfidelity  These directories may contain single or multitude of documents)\
**Project Roadmap** - we will capture a roadmap of how the product will evolve both here in the quarter as well as ideas of how it might grow beyond the time we have with  (/specs/roadmap.md)
